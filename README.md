# May-friend
May is your friend who helps you in doing your all day tasks, like google assistant(not so advanced lol), but your own.
## Installation
Just pull it & Run it.
## Points to Watch out
Uncomment the ```wants``` if you want to type the thing you want to say.
```python
# wants = input("\n\nEnter: ").lower()
```
## Usage
Just speak and ask anything to it. Can use google search and I may add universal music play from Youtube (youtube doesn't like it lol). Can use your music from a folder from your localdisk. And you can explore for more.
